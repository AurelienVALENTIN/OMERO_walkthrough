# FUNCTIONS
def import_image(image_path: str, dataset_id: int) -> int:
    """Import an image using in-place import (avoinding to copy your data), see the "LINKS" section below.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_path: str
        The local path to your image. It can be a path to an image on a server that you can browse from your machine.
    dataset_id: int
        The ID of the dataset where your image should be located.
    
    Returns
    -------
    image_id : int
        The ID of the image uploaded.
    
    Note
    ----
    This function uses the CLI (Command Line Interface) since no equivalent with Python was found.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name: str
        The name of the object.
    type: int
        The type of the object, e. g. Image, Dataset or Project.
    
    Returns
    -------
    object_id: int
        The ID researched of the object.
    
    Note
    ----
    Be careful with the use of this function since in OMERO you can use the same name for different objects. This function
    is coded to detect that but it is not necessary in the example shown.
